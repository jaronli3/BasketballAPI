Project Description:
We will make a sports statistics database. You will be able to look up athletes across various sports (tentatively football, basketball, and baseball). You will be able to filter athletes based on their respective sport or certain variable thresholds. The write operations will include adding new athletes to the database and updating an athlete's statistics.
